MozEditor
=========

Editor embedded in mozilla browser. This plugin doesn't use a network or
network services for editing. Everything happens on the local machine.
You can open, edit and save local files.

This project is inspired by the [sky-edit], but has a much simpler design.
This code uses only [JQuery] and [JQueryUI] (at least now).

This project also uses [Jetpack] and [ACE].
